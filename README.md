# I2Ctest
This is a library for interactively creating I2C (Inter-IC Protocol, also known as Two-Wire Interface) transactions, storing the transactions and expected data as tests. 

This is to support the interactive setup, configuration, bring-up testing, acceptance and integration testing, and even operational use of I2C. 

To use it, open I2Ctest/I2Ctest.ino in the Arduino or Energia IDE.
